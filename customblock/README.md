# CustomBlock

A quick look at a custom block that can give ideas for a package of blocks needed

## Initialisation

From the interfaces, one can identify some of the parameters needed for TTN which could be created by reusing the definition of serial.redirect with addition of extra paramters. A parameter for the type of LoRaWAN module used is recommended: at the present time, RN2483 is used for disection.

Note: that a LoRaWAN module has an EUI: this is used in registration on TTN and should be known at TTN Registration by some means. The TTN values needed are from TTN Registration and are needed at Initialisation.

* Basic Serial for target
  * define tx/rx pins
  * baud 57600
* Init of RN2483 with
  * Over The Air Activation (OTA) - preferred <https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/devices/registration.html> 
    * `bool initOTA(const uint8_t devEUI[8], const uint8_t appEUI[8], const uint8_t appKey[16], bool adr = true);`
  * Activation By Personization (ABP) 
    * `bool initABP(const uint8_t devAddr[4], const uint8_t appSKey[16], const uint8_t nwkSKey[16], bool adr = true);`
